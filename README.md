# Advent of Code 2021

## Context

I decided to go through some of the challenges of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

You'll see on this repo the code I'm writing for that, basicaly all in JS.

If you want to test it, please feel free to clone and then

```npm init```
```node index```
